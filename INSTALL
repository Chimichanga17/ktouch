Retrieving the source
---------------------

After a subversion checkout of the kdeedu module you will automatically have the
ktouch directory inside the kdeedu directory.

If you want to update/checkout ktouch alone, use

    svn checkout -P kdeedu/ktouch
    
or

    svn update -P kdeedu/ktouch

The flag -P is recommanded so that empty directories left over from previous 
versions are not transferred.
